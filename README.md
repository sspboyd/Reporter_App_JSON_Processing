Reporter App JSON Processing
============================

Parsing Reporter App's JSON exported data in Processing

This quick sketch illustrates the basics of loading a JSON from Report App (@ReporterApp) into Processing. 

This sketch shows you how to parse "Yes/No" type questions and count the number of responses for each answer. I've included a small amount of error checking based on the kinds of issues I've run across in using the JSON exported data.

There is a more fulsome implementation of this code which uses the date time of each answer to create a histogram 
showing the frequency of times you've answered yes or no to a question during a period of time in the day. The code
is online here:
