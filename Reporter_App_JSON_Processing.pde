/* 
This is a quick sketch to illustrate the basics of loading a JSON file exported out of Report App (@ReporterApp) into Processing. 
This sketch shows you how to parse "Yes/No" type questions and count the number of responses for each answer. 
I've included a small amount of error checking based on the kinds of issues I've run across in using the JSON exported data.
There is a more fulsome implementation of this code which uses the date time of each answer to create a histogram 
showing the frequency of times you've answered yes or no to a question during a period of time in the day. The code
is online here:

//Declare Globals
JSONObject raj; // This is the variable that we load the JSON file into. It's not much use to us after that.
JSONArray snapshots; // This is the variable that holds all the 'snapshots' recorded by Reporter App. We'll use this variable a lot.
String question; // This will be the exact text of the Yes/No questions to be parsed.
